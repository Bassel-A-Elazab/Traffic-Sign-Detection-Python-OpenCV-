# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Python-OpenCV-

# Introduction
  * There are many way to detect and recognition traffic sign like :- <br>
    - Haar Cascade. <br>
    - HOG+SVM linear transform. <br>
    - Machine Learning (eg. Tensorflow). <br>
    - Deep Learning (Yolo , Yolo2 , CNN , ) and other. <br>
    
  * In my code here i used "Haar Cascade" method and make training for three types of traffic sign (Stop Sign , Turn Right & Turn Left Ahead Signs). <br>
