# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Python-OpenCV-

# Introduction
  * There are many way to detect and recognition traffic sign like :- <br>
  
    - Haar Cascade. <br>
    - HOG + SVM linear transform. <br>
    - Machine Learning (eg. Tensorflow). <br>
    - Deep Learning (Yolo , Yolo2 , CNN , ) and other. <br>
    
  * In my code here i used "Haar Cascade" method and make training for three types of traffic sign (Stop Sign , Turn Right & Turn Left Ahead Signs). <br>
  
  * To make your owm xml file to detect specific traffic sign by using "Haar Cascade" you can follow [this](https://github.com/Bassel-elazab/Make-Your-Own-Object-Detector).<br>
  
  * You can get your traffic sign and working with all method i mentioned from [here](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset#Downloads)
  
  # Instruction 
  
   * You can follow [this](https://github.com/Bassel-elazab/Make-Your-Own-Object-Detector) to understand well all steps
   
   * Finally after you make your xml file you can use it in detection as i explain in my code "detection.py"
